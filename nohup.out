Error in checkNumberOfLocalWorkers(workers) : 
  Attempting to set up 30 localhost parallel workers with only 8 CPU cores available for this R process (per ‘system’), which could result in a 375% load. The hard limit is set to 300%. Overusing the CPUs has negative impact on the current R process, but also on all other processes of yours and others running on the same machine. See help("parallelly.options", package = "parallelly") for how to override the soft and hard limits
